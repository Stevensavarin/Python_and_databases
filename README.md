# Python_and_databases
In the folder "Python_databases" I let a txt file that I created when I was solving problems that I had and I made the annotations there, 
I also let the list of the packages installed in my env(environment) at the time I created the project.
packages installed in my environment at the time of creating the project. Of course it is good that you try to solve your own problems and make your own guide as you solve them.
but still I leave it in case you have a problem similar to mine. the txt file is in Spanish because it is my native language but you can translate it.
